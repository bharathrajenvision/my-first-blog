The Aim of this Project is to host a web apllication using Django.  

## Getting Started

Started by installing Django(latest version) and Python using the Home Brew.


### Prerequisites

Things you need to install like software and how to install them

```
1. Django 2.2.4
2. Python 3.7.3
3.Bootstraping Colours and Styles in HTML.
4.Code Editor (Sublime Text)
5.Visual Studio Code
6.GitHub
7.PythonAnywhere
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get  development env running

Say what the step will be

```
1. Installing Python

Django is written in Python. We need Python to do anything in Django. Let's start by installing it! We want you to install the latest version of Python 3, so if you have any earlier version, you will need to upgrade it. If you already have version 3.4 or higher you should be fine.
```
```
2. Installing A Code Editor

There are a lot of different editors and it largely boils down to personal preference. Most Python programmers use complex but extremely powerful IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), such as PyCharm. As a beginner, however, that's probably less suitable.

```

```
3. Sublime Text 3

Sublime Text is a very popular editor with a free evaluation period and it's available for all operating systems.


```

```
4. Virtual Environment

It is neccessary to create a Virtual Envirinment for Development of Project. We obviously dont want to make a mess of files by switching here and there.
A Virtual environment will do the Job. 



```

```
5. Installing Git

Git is a "version control system" used by a lot of programmers. This software can track changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. A bit like the "track changes" feature in word processor programs (e.g., Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer), but much more powerful.

```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
